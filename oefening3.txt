PHP Object Oriented Programming(OOP)

het verschil tussen:
private, protected & public.

You use:
Public: scope to make that variable/function available from anywhere, other classes and instances of the object.
Private: scope when you want your variable/function to be visible in its own class only.
Protected: scope when you want to make your variable/function visible in all classes that extend current class including the parent class.
